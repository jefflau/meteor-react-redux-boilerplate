# Meteor starter boilerplate setup with react and redux client

##Installation

```bash
$ npm install
$ meteor
```

##Explanation

This boilerplate users Meteor as a backend as well as Minimongo to deal with updating the database, but the frontend uses React, Redux and React Router for everything else. It is based on the tutorial by Abhi Ayer who wrote a great series on integrating Redux with Meteor, which you can read [here](https://medium.com/modern-user-interfaces/how-we-redux-part-1-introduction-18a24c3b7efe#.b3v1ww8jl)
